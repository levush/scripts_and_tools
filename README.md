# scripts_and_tools
small tools and scripts I wrote or found and modified

PLEASE NOTE:

The license information should be contained in the scripts.
Also the Authors should be mentioned in the scripts.
When I modified something, it should be noted as a comment
in the scripts/files/source, you name it.

Have fun with it, and comment if you like.
